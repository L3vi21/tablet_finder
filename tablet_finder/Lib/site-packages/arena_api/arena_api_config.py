- arena_api is built on the C API (ArenaC) for Arena SDK. arena_api loads
  the ArenaC binary and its dependencies automatically from the Arena SDK's default
  installation directory. To load the ArenaC binary from a custom location
  add the full path to ArenaC binary as a value to a valid key in the dictionary.
  The dictionary name must be ``ARENAC_CUSTOM_PATHS`` and must have all of
  the following keys:

   'python32_win' :
       - Used to point Python 32 on Windows to load the 32-bit ArenaC binary.
       - If this key has a value of empty string, arena_api loads
         '<Installation Dir>\\Win32Release\\ArenaC_v140.dll'.

   'python64_win' :
       - Used to point Python 64 on Windows to load the 64-bit ArenaC binary.
       - If this key has a value of empty string, arena_api loads
         '<Installation Dir>\\x64Release\\ArenaC_v140.dll'.

   'python32_lin' :
       - Used to point Python 32 on Linux to load the 32-bit ArenaC binary.
       - If this key has a value of empty string, arena_api uses the paths in
         '/etc/ld.so.conf.d/Arena_SDK.conf' to find the ArenaC shared object.

   'python64_lin' :
       - Used to point Python 64 on Linux to load the 64-bit ArenaC binary.
       - If this key has a value of empty string, arena_api uses the paths in
         '/etc/ld.so.conf.d/Arena_SDK.conf' to find the ArenaC shared object.

 Note:
  - If the library path assigned to any of the keys does not
    exist, a FileNotFoundError exception will be thrown.
  - Linux keys have been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
  - To use the installed arena, give the key a value of empty string ''.
  - If ArenaSDK is not installed in the default location,
    'C:\Program Files\Lucid Vision Labs\Arena SDK', by the installer , it is
    not necessary to add the non-default installation path to the custom paths.
